INST326 Section 0301

Week 1
This week, I used AI, specifically ChatGPT, to refresh me on topics from INST126 to help with the weekly exercises. I specifically asked for refreshers on f-strings, inputs, .find, .rfind, and what no branching meant. Besides that, I have not used AI too much, except for help with changing the repo visibility in GitHub since it is my first time using it. AI on Google also helped me find information on The Hobbit as a book example in the exercises. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c5c9d1-0c64-8013-8383-e9c8f37d44da

Week 2
This week, I used ChatGPT to help my team complete the Team Charter. I copied and pasted the rubric into AI and asked it to put it in question form to help us fulfill the requirements in a direct question form. Here is that AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68ce061d-87b0-8013-a133-922f8aff6213/
Besides that, I used AI to refresh me on loops and using range() and len() in loops, similar to last week. I am curious about trying out Claude AI too since it seems it can search through my Google Drive to pull documents instead of pasting them. 

Week 3
In week 3, I used ChatGPT to help me further grasp enumerate() in loops. Also, I had to use AI a bit more this week than last week to help me walk through the logic, as it felt repetitive, and I had to make sure I was getting it right.

Week 4
In week 4, I used ChatGPT to help me with GitHub. These are things I could have found online, but I prompted ChatGPT to help set up the new repo for our first project. Also, I was unsure of how to create a new folder instead of just a new file, so it showed me that I just need to add a "/" at the end to make it into a folder.

Week 5
In week 5, I signed up for the free Gemini student account, but have yet to really use or test it for this class. As for Project 1, I used ChatGPT to help me with GitHub formatting of .md files, such as readme.md files. I was mainly unsure how to use markdown to separate information and code nicely.

Week 6
In week 6, I tried something new with summarizing the lecture file to reapply what was learned in a different way. It was helpful to have it explained to me by a chatbot as well. In addition to that, I had asked ChatGPT to re-explain some topics, such as @classmethod, as a refresher before completing the weekly exercises.
